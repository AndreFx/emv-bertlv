A library for deciphering [BER TLV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#BER_encoding) data used in [EMV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV) (chip card transactions).

Used in a little [tool](http://tvr-decoder.appspot.com/t/home) hosted on Google's AppEngine.

The tests provide some idea of what kind of data this code can decipher. The [EMVCo](http://www.emvco.com/specifications.aspx) website has the full (1000+ page) specs. Add to that the Visa, Mastercard and Amex documents.
